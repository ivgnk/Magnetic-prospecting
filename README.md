#### Data
Ball parameters:           
The ball is vertically magnetized
h - the depth of the center of the ball in meters         
R - the radius of the ball in meters        
J - magnetization in A/m             
The magnetic field is calculated on a straight line (profile) with coordinates from -250 m to 250 m with step 5 m.    
The origin of the coordinates is above the center of the ball       

#### Formulas: 
In [International System of Units, SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)             
Magnetic moment of the ball               
$$\Big[M = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \pi \cdot J \cdot R^3]$$

Vertical component         
$$Z_a = M $$

Horizontal component

Full vector
